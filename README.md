## My process

I started off with laying out the website for desktop users first, I then realized after having a lot of the site done to make it fully responsive I wanted to make it mobile friendly first and then add the complexity later for desktop. So I ended up redoing the entire css, and came out with the product that is live now!

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS
- Flexbox
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

This site helped me learn a lot about reposive design, and being able to build the site for all resolutions. I made this site 100% responsive for anyone to enjoy.

### Continued development

I feel that I want to continue working on my skills with flexbox, and learning the positioning attrivutes.
